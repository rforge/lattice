S-PLUS compatibility: [these are sections deleted from the main docs, and should eventually be included in a vignette]

  Most high level Trellis functions in S-PLUS are
  implemented, with the exception of \code{piechart}.

  The public interface is based on the
  implementation in S-PLUS, but features several extensions, in addition
  to incompatibilities introduced through the use of \code{grid}.  To
  the extent possible, care has been taken to ensure that existing
  Trellis code written for S-PLUS works unchanged (or with minimal
  change) in Lattice. If you are having problems porting S-PLUS code,
  read the entry for \code{panel} in the documentation for
  \code{\link{xyplot}}. 

  To the extent
  possible, care has been taken to ensure that Trellis code written for
  S works unchanged (or with minimal changes) in Lattice.
