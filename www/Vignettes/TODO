How to do multiple grouping in lattice: 

  Easy in ggplot2.  One variable for color, other for line type.  To do 
  this in lattice, one option is to have interaction groups etc. (in book?).
  Other option is to map variables to vector col, pch., etc. using a simple
  function (along with with() to get non-standard-like evaluation).  Legend
  can be done with combine.legends() type function in latticeExtra (needs work?). 




S-PLUS compatibility: [these are sections deleted from the main docs, and should eventually be included in a vignette]

  Most high level Trellis functions in S-PLUS are
  implemented, with the exception of \code{piechart}.

  The public interface is based on the
  implementation in S-PLUS, but features several extensions, in addition
  to incompatibilities introduced through the use of \code{grid}.  To
  the extent possible, care has been taken to ensure that existing
  Trellis code written for S-PLUS works unchanged (or with minimal
  change) in Lattice. If you are having problems porting S-PLUS code,
  read the entry for \code{panel} in the documentation for
  \code{\link{xyplot}}. 

  To the extent
  possible, care has been taken to ensure that Trellis code written for
  S works unchanged (or with minimal changes) in Lattice.
